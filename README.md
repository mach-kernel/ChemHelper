## What is it?

In the 9th grade I decided to write a TI program to help me do my chemistry homework. ChemHelper can do H20 change reactions and conversions. I believe that these files are the most recent ones that I have, but I also have some development versions. Use at your own risk; the answers it provides may be wrong. Not maintained since my freshman year in high school.
